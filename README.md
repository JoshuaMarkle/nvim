# Nvim Config or Something

Just a bunch of experimenting :)

Trying to learn the nvim ropes and make a config that suits me

## Download

If you can, back up `~/.config/nvim`

**Uninstall Nvim**
```
# Linux / Macos (unix)
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim

# Windows
rd -r ~\AppData\Local\nvim
rd -r ~\AppData\Local\nvim-data
```

The command: `git clone https://github.com/JoshuaMarkle/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim`

> I am not sure what the command looks like for Windows or Mac but I assume it is something very similiar.
